challenge dec 14th due date

Horiseon web application

Description
This web application is for search engine optimization. This was also the challenge for the first section of my bootcamp. I was provided with a working website that needed some things changed and improved. I was able to locate the error in the code to be able to get all of the links functioning properly. I also gave the webpage a working title as well as cleaned up some of the repetitive style code by reclassifying and condensing.

Usage
This application is for people to see what this company can offer such as optimizing search results, providing social media marketing, and managing online reputation.
